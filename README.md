# DiscordLogger  

Discord direct message logger.

Any message sent while the script is running will detect if a user deletes or edits a message.  
Then replies with an embed of what message/file was deleted/edited.  

Make a folder called 'media' to store files recieved.  
Also this doesn't account for messages that were before you ran the script. (Even after restarting the script).  
In other words, you have to run this 24/7 and if you restart it, then messages even when the script was running aren't accounted.  
I'll fix this when I can be bothered, this was more for my entertainment as people tried to delete messages.
